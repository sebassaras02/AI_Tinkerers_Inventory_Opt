# AI Tinkerers Inventory Optimization

This repository contains a demonstration of the **RLInventoryOpt** library, which utilizes reinforcement learning for inventory optimization. The demo was showcased at the **AI Tinkerers** event in Quito on April 24th - 2025.

## Description

The **RLInventoryOpt** library optimizes inventory levels based on forecasted demand using reinforcement learning techniques. The implementation learns the best restocking strategy, considering parameters such as initial stock, safety stock, maximum capacity, and lead time.

Features include:
- **Dynamic actions:** Define actions in the format `"Xm"` (e.g., `"10m"`, `"100m"`) to order different quantities.
- **Reward calculation:** Rewards are assigned based on the current inventory state.
- **Order simulation:** Orders are simulated with a specified lead time.
- **Result visualization:** Graphs and analysis of inventory levels over time.

## Requirements

- RLInventoryOpt == 0.1.6
- Link to the library [LINK](https://github.com/sebassaras02/rf_inventory_optimization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    pip install RLInventoryOpt
    ```
